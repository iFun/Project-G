# Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
#
# Note:
#
# The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
# You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: 5
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
#
#
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: 1
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:

        string = str(bin(num)[2:])
        result = ''
        for bit in string:
            if bit == '0':
                result += '1'
            else:
                result += '0'

        return int(result, 2)
