# You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
#
# Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
#
# Note: Given n will be a positive integer.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
# 1. 1 step + 1 step
# 2. 2 steps
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: 3
# Output: 3
# Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
# 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
# 2. 1 step + 2 steps
# 3. 2 steps + 1 step

class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n < 2:
            return 1
        if n is 2:
            return 2

        stepOne = 2
        stepTwo = 1
        result = 3

        for _ in range(2, n):
            result = stepOne + stepTwo
            stepTwo = stepOne
            stepOne = result

        return result
