# Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.
#
# You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: [3,2,3]
# Output: 3
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
# Output: 2
