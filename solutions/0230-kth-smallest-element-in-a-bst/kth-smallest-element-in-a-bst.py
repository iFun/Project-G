# Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.
#
# Note: 
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
#    3
#   / \
#  1   4
#   \
#    2
# Output: 1
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
#        5
#       / \
#      3   6
#     / \
#    2   4
#   /
#  1
# Output: 3
#
#
# Follow up:
# What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
