# Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
#
# Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
#
# Determine if you are able to reach the last index.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: [3,2,1,0,4]
# Output: false
# Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum
# Â             jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        if nums[0] >= len(nums) - 1:
            return True
        # greedy from back of the list
        # check to see if a given index i can reach the last position
        # the "starting" last position is the last index

        last_position = len(nums) - 1
        for index, num in reversed(list(enumerate(nums))):
            if num + index >= last_position:
                last_position = index
            index -= 1
        return last_position is 0
