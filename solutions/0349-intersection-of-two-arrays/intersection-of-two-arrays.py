# Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
# Output: [2]
#
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
# Output: [9,4]
#
#
# Note:
#
#
# 	Each element in the result must be unique.
# 	The result can be in any order.

# This is a Facebook interview question.
# They ask for the intersection, which has a trivial solution using a hash or a set.

# Then they ask you to solve it under these constraints:
# O(n) time and O(1) space (the resulting array of intersections is not taken into consideration).
# You are told the lists are sorted.

# Cases to take into consideration include:
# duplicates, negative values, single value lists, 0's, and empty list arguments.
# Other considerations might include
# sparse arrays.

class Solution:
    def intersection(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        nums1.sort() #assume sorted
        nums2.sort() #assume sorted
